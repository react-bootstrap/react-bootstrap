React-Bootstrap v2 adds full compatibility with Bootstrap 5. Because Bootstrap 5 is a major rewrite of the project, there
are significant breaking changes from React-Bootstrap v1.

**PLEASE FIRST READ THE UPSTREAM BOOTSTRAP MIGRATION GUIDE**

> <DocLink path="/migration">View migration guide</DocLink>

React-Bootstrap _only_ contains components that are present in vanilla Bootstrap. If functionality
was removed from Bootstrap, then it was also removed from React-Bootstrap. This guide does not
repeat information found in the upstream migration guide. Its goal is to document React-Bootstrap-specific
API changes and additions.

## Versioning

We will continue to provide general maintenance for Bootstrap 4 components, because there are many projects that continue to depend on Bootstrap 4 support in `react-bootstrap`. `react-bootstrap` package versions will be as follows:

- Bootstrap 3 support will continue in react-bootstrap versions < `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 4 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 5 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v2.0.0`

We are **not** committing to keeping breaking changes in lockstep with bootstraps major releases,
there may be a React-Bootstrap v3 targeting Bootstrap 6 depending on what's best for the project.

## Summary of breaking changes from v2.x

Below is a _rough_ account of the breaking API changes as well as the minimal change to migrate

### General

- React >= 18.3.1 is now required

### AccordionButton

- `useAccordionButton` is now exported from its own file. You can now import via `import useAccordionButton from 'react-bootstrap/useAccordionButton'`.

### Collapse

- collapse now requires a child component that forwards the ref to the underlying HTML element.

### Fade

- fade now requires a child component that forwards the ref to the underlying HTML element.
