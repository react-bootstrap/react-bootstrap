## Available breakpoints

Bootstrap includes six default breakpoints, sometimes referred to as _grid tiers_,
for building responsively. These breakpoints can be customized if youâ€™re using our
source Sass files.

<BreakpointTable />

## Custom breakpoints

If you are looking to use custom breakpoints, you must wrap your application with
a theme provider and use the `breakpoints` prop to specify the breakpoints you
will use. This ensures that components such as `Row` or `Col` can parse the
correct custom breakpoint props.

<CodeBlock language="jsx">{CustomBreakpoints}</CodeBlock>
