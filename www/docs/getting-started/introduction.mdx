## Installation

The best way to consume React-Bootstrap is via the npm package which
you can install with `npm` (or `yarn` if you prefer).

If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want
to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to
install <DocLink path="/getting-started/download/#npm">vanilla Bootstrap</DocLink> as well.

```bash
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

## Importing Components

You should import individual components like:
`react-bootstrap/Button` rather than the entire library.
Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which
can significantly reduce the amount of code you end up sending to
the client.

```jsx
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

// or less ideally
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```

### Browser globals

We provide `react-bootstrap.js` and
`react-bootstrap.min.js` bundles with all components
exported on the `window.ReactBootstrap` object. These
bundles are available on [jsDelivr](https://www.jsdelivr.com/package/npm/react-bootstrap), as
well as in the npm package.

```js
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>

<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-dom/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"
  crossorigin></script>

<script
  src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/react-bootstrap@next/dist/react-bootstrap.min.js"
  crossorigin></script>

<script>var Alert = ReactBootstrap.Alert;</script>
```

## Examples

React-Bootstrap has started a repo with a few basic CodeSandbox examples.
[Click here](https://github.com/react-bootstrap/code-sandbox-examples/blob/master/README.md)
to check them out.

## Stylesheets

Because React-Bootstrap doesn't depend on a very precise version of
Bootstrap, we don't ship with any included CSS. However, some
stylesheet **is required** to use these components.

### CSS

```jsx
{
  /* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */
}
import 'bootstrap/dist/css/bootstrap.min.css';
```

How and which Bootstrap styles you include is up to you, but the
simplest way is to include the latest styles from the CDN. A little
more information about the benefits of using a CDN can be found
[here](https://www.w3schools.com/bootstrap/bootstrap_get_started.asp).

### Sass

In case you are using **Sass** the simplest way is to include the Bootstrapâ€™s source Sass files
in your main Sass file and then require it on your `src/index.js` or `App.js` file.
This applies to a typical `create-react-app` application in other use cases you might have to setup
the bundler of your choice to compile Sass/SCSS stylesheets to CSS.

```css
/* The following line can be included in a src/App.scss */
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
```

```jsx
/* The following line can be included in your src/index.js or App.js file */
import './App.scss';
```

#### Customize Bootstrap

If you wish to customize the Bootstrap theme or any Bootstrap variables
you can create a custom Sass file:

```css
/* The following block can be included in a custom.scss */

/* make the customizations */
$theme-colors: (
  'info': tomato,
  'danger': teal
);

/* import bootstrap to set changes */
@import '~bootstrap/scss/bootstrap';
```

... And import it on the main Sass file.

```css
/* The following line can be included in a src/App.scss */
@import 'custom';
```

### Advanced usage

See <DocLink path="/customize/overview">the Bootstrap docs</DocLink>
for more advanced use cases and details about customizing stylesheets.

## `as` Prop API

With certain React-Bootstrap components, you may want to modify the component or HTML tag
that is rendered.

If you want to keep all the styling of a particular React-Bootstrap component but switch the
component that is finally rendered (whether it's a different React-Bootstrap component, a
different custom component, or a different HTML tag) you can use the `as` prop to do so.

The example below passes an anchor to the `as` prop in a `Button` component. This
ultimately causes a `a` tag to be rendered but with the same styles as a `Button`
component.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" live>
  {AsPropButtonExample}
</CodeBlock>

Below is an illustration of passing a React Bootstrap component. It contains a `Badge` component and a `Button`
component that have been supplied to the `as` prop. This finally results in the rendering of a `Button` component
with the same styles as a `Badge` component.

<CodeBlock language="jsx" live>
  {AsPropComponent}
</CodeBlock>

## Themes

React-Bootstrap is compatible with existing Bootstrap themes. Just
follow the installation instructions for your theme of choice.

:::danger Watch out!

Because React-Bootstrap completely reimplements Bootstrap's JavaScript, it's
not automatically compatible with themes that extend the default JavaScript
behaviors.

:::caution Create React App

If you would like to add a custom theme on your app using Create React
App, they have additional documentation for Create React App and
Bootstrap
[here](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-bootstrap#using-a-custom-theme)

## Browser support

We aim to support all browsers supported by both
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html#browser-support-and-polyfills)
and <DocLink path="/getting-started/browsers-devices/#supported-browsers">Bootstrap</DocLink>.
