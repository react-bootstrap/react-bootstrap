## Overview

Create custom `<input type="range">` controls with `<FormRange>`. The track
(the background) and thumb (the value) are both styled to appear the same
across browsers. As only Firefox supports “filling” their track from the left
or right of the thumb as a means to visually indicate progress, we do not
currently support it.
