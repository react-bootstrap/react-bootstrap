<PageHeader title="Migrating to v2" />

React-Bootstrap v2 adds full compatibility with Bootstrap 5. Because Bootstrap 5 is a major rewrite of the project, there
are significant breaking changes from React-Bootstrap v1.

**PLEASE FIRST READ THE UPSTREAM BOOSTRAP MIGRATION GUIDE**

> https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration

React-Bootstrap _only_ contains components that are present in vanilla Bootstrap. If functionality
was removed from Bootstrap, then it was also removed from React-Bootstrap. This guide does not
repeat information found in the upstream migration guide. Its goal is to document React-Bootstrap-specific
API changes and additions.

## Versioning

We will continue to provide general maintenance for Bootstrap 4 components, because there are many projects that continue to depend on Bootstrap 4 support in
`react-bootstrap`. `react-bootstrap` package versions will be as follows:

- Bootstrap 3 support will continue in react-bootstrap versions < `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 4 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 5 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v2.0.0`

We are **not** committing to keeping breaking changes in lockstep with bootstraps major releases,
there may be a React-Bootstrap v3 targeting Bootstrap 6 depending on what's best for the project.
