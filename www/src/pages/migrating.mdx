# Migrating to v1

React Bootstrap v1 adds full compatibility with Bootstrap 4. Because bootstrap 4 is a major rewrite of the project there
are significant breaking changes from the pre `v1` react-bootstrap.

**PLEASE FIRST READ THE UPSTREAM BOOSTRAP MIGRATION GUIDE**

> https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/migration/

React-Bootstrap _only_ contains components that are present in vanilla Bootstrap. If functionality
was removed from Bootstrap, then it was also removed from React-Bootstrap. This guide does not
repeat information found in the upstream migration guide. Its goal is to document React-Bootstrap-specific
API changes and additions.

## Versioning

We will continue to provide general maintenance for Bootstrap 3 components, because there are many projects that continue to depend on Bootstrap 3 support in
`react-bootstrap`. `react-bootstrap` package versions will be as follows:

- Bootstrap 3 support will continue in react-bootstrap versions < `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 4 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v1.0.0`

We are **not** committing to keeping breaking changes in lockstep with bootstraps major releases,
there may be a react-bootstrap v2 targeting Bootstrap v4 depending on what's best for the project.

## Summary of breaking changes from v0.32.0

Below is a _rough_ account of the breaking API changes as well as the minimal change to migrate

- `bsStyle` -> `variant`
- `bsClass` -> `bsPrefix`
- `bsRole` has been removed from all components. Components now communicate
  via context to allow intermediate nesting of child components
- `componentClass` -> `as`
- All utils have been removed from main exports, most were internal already and the rest have been moved to external libraries

### Grid

- renamed to Container
- removed Clearfix

#### Col

- removed visibility props
- consolidated col `span`, `offset`, and `order` into an object value prop per breakpoint.

### Navbar

- removed `Navbar.Header`
- removed `Navbar.Form`
- removed `fluid`, use your own `Container` component in.
- `inverse` removed and replaced with `variant="dark"`
- positioning props have been consolidated into `fixed={top|bottom}` and `sticky={top|bottom}`, staticTop has been removed

#### NavbarHeader

- removed, not present in v4

#### NavbarToggle

- name changed to `Navbar.Toggle`

- `bsStyle` renamed to `variant`
- NavLink hrefs will be used as `eventKey`s when `eventKey` is absent
- Local `onSelect` handlers are ignored when in the context of a TabContainer or Navbar (MAYBE ADD BACK?)

#### Nav.Item

- Renders _only_ the outer "item" element, use inconjunction with the new `NavLink` component
- default element changed to `<div>` from a `<li>`
- `active` prop removed and moved to `NavLink`

### InputGroup

- removed InputGroup.Button, and InputGroup.Addon
- added InputGroup.Prepend, InputGroup.Append, InputGroup.Text, InputGroup.Checkbox, InputGroup.Radio

- Removed bsRole, use function children to render custom Toggles or Menus
- Removed SplitButton.toggle (replaced with a `split` prop on the basic Toggle)

- onSelect behavior is now passed to Menu and Toggle via the Context api
- DropdownMenu is not rendered until opened
