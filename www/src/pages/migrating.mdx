# Migrating to v2

React-Bootstrap v2 adds full compatibility with Bootstrap 5. Because Bootstrap 5 is a major rewrite of the project, there
are significant breaking changes from React-Bootstrap v1.

**PLEASE FIRST READ THE UPSTREAM BOOSTRAP MIGRATION GUIDE**

> https://v5.getbootstrap.com/docs/5.0/migration

React-Bootstrap _only_ contains components that are present in vanilla Bootstrap. If functionality
was removed from Bootstrap, then it was also removed from React-Bootstrap. This guide does not
repeat information found in the upstream migration guide. Its goal is to document React-Bootstrap-specific
API changes and additions.

## Versioning

We will continue to provide general maintenance for Bootstrap 4 components, because there are many projects that continue to depend on Bootstrap 4 support in
`react-bootstrap`. `react-bootstrap` package versions will be as follows:

- Bootstrap 3 support will continue in react-bootstrap versions < `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 4 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v1.0.0`
- Bootstrap 5 support will be in react-bootstrap versions >= `v2.0.0`

We are **not** committing to keeping breaking changes in lockstep with bootstraps major releases,
there may be a React-Bootstrap v3 targeting Bootstrap 6 depending on what's best for the project.

## Summary of breaking changes from v1.x

Below is a _rough_ account of the breaking API changes as well as the minimal change to migrate

### ButtonGroup

- removed `toggle`.

### CloseButton

- Removed `label` prop in favor of `aria-label`.
- Added `variant` prop.

### Col

- `ColOrder` is now maximum 5 instead of 12.

### Dropdown
- dropdown dividers use `hr` by default instead of `div`.

### Form

- removed `inline`.
- removed `bsPrefix`.

### FormCheck

- deprecated `bsCustomPrefix` and `custom` in favor of `bsSwitchPrefix`.

#### FormCheckInput

- removed `bsCustomPrefix`.
- removed `isStatic`.

#### FormCheckLabel

- removed `bsCustomPrefix`.
- changed base class from `form-check-input` to `form-check-label`.

### FormControl

- dropped `as` prop supporting `select` tags in favor of FormSelect.
- removed `custom`.
- removed `bsCustomPrefix`.
- dropped support for `type` supporting the `range` value in favor of FormRange.
- add color picker

### FormGroup

- removed `bsPrefix`. The `.form-group` class is no longer supported in Bootstrap, 
but this component is useful for passing `controlId` to labels and inputs. To handle
spacing, use margin utilities instead.

### FormRow

- removed. Use `Row` instead.

### InputGroup

- dropped `InputGroupPrepend` and `InputGroupAppend`. Buttons and `InputGroupText` can now be added as direct children.

### ToggleButton

- add `bsPrefix`.
- `id` is now required. This is to allow toggling of the input due to markup changes in Bootstrap.
