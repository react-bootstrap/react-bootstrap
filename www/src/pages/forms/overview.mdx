## Overview

The `<FormControl>` component renders a form control with Bootstrap styling.
The `<FormGroup>` component wraps a form control with proper spacing, along
with support for a label, help text, and validation state. To ensure
accessibility, set `controlId` on `<FormGroup>`, and use `<FormLabel>` for
the label.

<ReactPlayground codeText={FormBasic} />

The `<FormControl>` component directly renders the `<input>` or other specified
component. If you need to access the value of an uncontrolled `<FormControl>`,
attach a `ref` to it as you would with an uncontrolled input, then call
`ReactDOM.findDOMNode(ref)` to get the DOM node. You can then interact with that
node as you would with any other uncontrolled input.

If your application contains a large number of form groups, we recommend
building a higher-level component encapsulating a complete field group
that renders the label, the control, and any other necessary components.
We don't provide this out-of-the-box, because the composition of those
field groups is too specific to an individual application to admit a
good one-size-fits-all solution.

## Disabled forms

Add the `disabled` boolean attribute on an input to prevent user interactions and
make it appear lighter.

<ReactPlayground codeText={FormDisabledInputs} />

Add the `disabled` attribute to a `<fieldset>` to disable all the controls within.

<ReactPlayground codeText={FormDisabled} />

Browsers treat all native form controls (`<input>`, `<select>` and `<button>` elements)
inside `<fieldset disabled>` as disabled, preventing both keyboard and mouse interactions
on them.

However, if your form also includes custom button-like elements such as
`<a ... class="btn btn-*">`, these will only be given a style of `pointer-events: none`,
meaning they are still focusable and operable using the keyboard. In this case, you must
manually modify these controls by adding `tabindex="-1"` to prevent them from receiving
focus and `aria-disabled="disabled"` to signal their state to assistive technologies.

## API

<ComponentApi metadata={props.data.Form} />
<ComponentApi metadata={props.data.FormLabel} exportedBy={props.data.Form} />

export const query = graphql`
  query FormQuery {
    Form: componentMetadata(displayName: { eq: "Form" }) {
      ...ComponentApi_metadata
    }
    FormLabel: componentMetadata(displayName: { eq: "FormLabel" }) {
      ...ComponentApi_metadata
    }
  }
`;
