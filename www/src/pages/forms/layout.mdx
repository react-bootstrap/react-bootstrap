# Layout

<p className="lead">
  Give your forms some structure—from inline to horizontal to custom grid
  implementations—with our form layout options.
</p>

## Forms

Every group of form fields should reside in a `<Form>` element. Bootstrap
provides no default styling for the `<Form>` element, but there are some
powerful browser features that are provided by default.

- New to browser forms? Consider reviewing [the MDN form docs](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTML/Element/form)
  for an overview and complete list of available attributes.
- `<button>`s within a `<Form>` default to `type="submit"`, so strive to be
  specific and always include a `type`.
- You can disable every form element within a form with the `disabled` attribute
  on the `<Form>`.

Since Bootstrap applies `display: block` and `width: 100%` to almost all our
form controls, forms will by default stack vertically. Additional classes can
be used to vary this layout on a per-form basis.

## Form groups

The `FormGroup` component is the easiest way to add some structure to forms.
It provides a flexible container for grouping of labels, controls, optional
help text, and form validation messaging. Use it with `fieldset`s, `div`s,
or nearly any other element.

You also add the `controlId` prop to accessibly wire the nested label and
input together via the `id`.

## Form grid

More complex forms can be built using the grid components. Use these for
form layouts that require multiple columns, varied widths, and additional
alignment options.

<ReactPlayground codeText={GridBasic} />

More complex layouts can also be created with the grid system.

## Horizontal form

Create horizontal forms with the grid by adding `as={Row}` to form groups and
using `Col` to specify the width of your labels and controls. Be sure to add
the `column ` prop to your `FormLabel`s as well so they’re vertically centered
with their associated form controls.

At times, you maybe need to use margin or padding utilities to create that
perfect alignment you need. For example, we’ve removed the `padding-top` on our
stacked radio inputs label to better align the text baseline.

### Horizontal form label sizing

You can size the `<FormLabel>` using the `column` prop as shown.

<ReactPlayground codeText={FormLabelSizing} />

## Column sizing

As shown in the previous examples, our grid system allows you to place any number
of `<Col>`s within a `<Row>`. They'll split the available width equally between
them. You may also pick a subset of your columns to take up more or less space,
while the remaining `<Col>`s equally split the rest, with specific column classes
like `<Col xs={7}>`.

<ReactPlayground codeText={GridColSizes} />

## Auto-sizing

The example below uses a flexbox utility to vertically center the contents and 
changes `<Col>` to `<Col xs="auto">` so that your columns only take up as much 
space as needed. Put another way, the column sizes itself based on on the contents.

<ReactPlayground codeText={GridAutoSizing} />

You can then remix that once again with size-specific column classes.

<ReactPlayground codeText={GridAutoSizingColMix} />

## API

<ComponentApi metadata={props.data.FormGroup} exportedBy={props.data.Form} />

export const query = graphql`
  query FormLayoutQuery {
    Form: componentMetadata(displayName: { eq: "Form" }) {
      ...ComponentApi_metadata
    }
    FormGroup: componentMetadata(displayName: { eq: "FormGroup" }) {
      ...ComponentApi_metadata
    }
  }
`;
