# Server-side Rendering

React-Bootstrap automatically generates an `id` for some 
components (such as `DropdownToggle`) if they are not provided.
This is done for accessibility purposes.

In server-side rendered applications, a `SSRProvider` must wrap
the application in order to ensure that the auto-generated ids
are consistent between the server and client.

```
import SSRProvider from 'react-bootstrap/SSRProvider';

<SSRProvider>
  <App />
</SSRProvider>
```
