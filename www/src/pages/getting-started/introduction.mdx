# Introduction

<p className="lead">Learn how to include React Bootstrap in your project</p>

## JavaScript

React-Bootstrap is a complete re-implementation of the Bootstrap
components using React. It has **no dependency on either `bootstrap.js` or jQuery**.
If you have React setup and React-Bootstrap installed you have everything you need.

### Installation

The best way to consume React Bootstrap is via the npm package which
you can install with `npm` (or yarn if you prefer).

If you plan on customizing the Bootstrap Sass files, or don't want
to use a CDN for the stylesheet, it may be helpful to
install <DocLink path="/getting-started/download/#npm">vanilla Bootstrap</DocLink> as well.

```
npm install react-bootstrap bootstrap
```

### Importing

You should import individual components like:
`react-bootstrap/Button` rather than the entire library.
Doing so pulls in only the specific components that you use, which
can significantly reduce the amount of code you end up sending to
the client.

```jsx
import Button from 'react-bootstrap/Button';

// or less ideally
import { Button } from 'react-bootstrap';
```

### Browser globals

We provide `react-bootstrap.js` and
`react-bootstrap.min.js` bundles with all components
exported on the `window.ReactBootstrap` object. These
bundles are available on [unpkg](https://unpkg.com/react-bootstrap/), as
well as in the npm package.

## Stylesheets

Because React-Bootstrap doesn't depend on a very precise version of
Bootstrap, we don't ship with any included css. However, some
stylesheet **is required** to use these components. How
and which bootstrap styles you include is up to you, but the
simplest way is to include the latest styles from the CDN.

For more advanced use cases you can also use a bundler like Webpack
or Browserify to include the css files for you as part of your build
process but that is beyond the scope of this guide. Also see
[http://getbootstrap.com/customize/](http://getbootstrap.com/customize/) for details about customizing stylesheets to match your component
use.

### Themes

React-Bootstrap is compatible with existing Bootstrap themes. Just
follow the installation instructions for your theme of choice.

  Because React-Bootstrap completely reimplements Bootstrap's JavaScript, it's
  not automatically compatible with themes that extend the default JavaScript
  behaviors.

## Browser support

We aim to support all browsers supported by both
[React](http://facebook.github.io/react/docs/working-with-the-browser.html#browser-support-and-polyfills)
and <DocLink path="/getting-started/browsers-devices/#supported-browsers">Bootstrap</DocLink>.
