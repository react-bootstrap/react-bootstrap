Often times you may need a more generic or low-level version of a
Bootstrap component. Many of the `react-bootstrap` components
are built on top of components from [@restart/ui](https://github.com/react-restart/ui).
If you find yourself at the limit of a Bootstrap component, consider using
the `@restart/ui` base component directly.
