# NOTE
This is mainly the v0.32 typings with a few updates for v1.  The level of v1 compliance will improve over time. 

Below is a list of components that have started to be updated/checked and (at least to some extent) to work:

* Container (renamed from Grid)
* Col
* Row
* Dropdown (inc .Toggle .Menu, .Item)
* NavDropdown (inc. Item)
* Navbar (inc .Brand .Toggle .Collapse)
* ButtonGroup
* Button

Many other v0.32 definitions may work for you 'out of the box' or with minor edits.  

The readme.md for v0.32 follows.
