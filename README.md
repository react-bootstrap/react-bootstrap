## Overview

Our project's core offering consists of a versatile collection of React components, each encapsulating a specific Bootstrap 5 UI element or feature. These components are designed to be highly modular, allowing you to mix and match them to build your web application. Some of the key components included are:

* **Buttons**: Customize the style and functionality of buttons. <br>
* **Dropdowns**: Create dropdown menus with various options and styling. <br>
* **Collapse**: Add collapsible sections and accordions. <br>
* **Modals**: Implement pop-up modal dialogs with ease. <br>
* **Navbars**: Construct responsive navigation bars. <br>
* **And More**: Explore a wide array of additional components to address various aspects of your project.

If you're new to these frameworks, we recommend quickly going through the official **[React][react]** and **[Bootstrap 5][bootstrap]** documentation.

## Installation & compatibility

## Local setup

We use Yarn as our preferred package manager. If you haven't already installed Yarn, please refer to the [setup instructions](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) to get started. Once Yarn is installed, you can run the command `yarn run bootstrap` to install all the necessary dependencies.

From there you can:

- Run the tests once with `yarn test` (Or run them in watch mode with `yarn run tdd`)
- Start a local copy of the docs site with `yarn start`
- Build a local copy of the library with `yarn run build`

<br>

*Note:* If you are using PowerShell in VS Code, you might encounter a 'yarn.ps1 cannot be loaded' error when running `yarn --version` to check if Yarn was installed correctly on your system. This error occurs due to disabled script execution on the system. To resolve this issue, consider either of the following options:

1. Use an Alternate Terminal: Try using Git Bash or Windows Terminal, which may not have the same script execution restrictions as PowerShell.

2. Change PowerShell Execution Policy: Refer to the [official documentation](https://go.microsoft.com/fwlink/?LinkID=135170) for guidance on changing the script execution policies in PowerShell.
