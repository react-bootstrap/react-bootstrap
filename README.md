If you would like to update React-Bootstrap within an existing project to use Bootstrap 4, please read our docs for **[migrating to React-Bootstrap V1](https://react-bootstrap.netlify.com/migrating/)**.

* [React Bootstrap Extended][react-bootstrap-extended] - A version of React Bootstrap where each component has extra props that map to bootstrap's utility classes. For example, `pullRight` adds the class `pull-right` to a component.

## Local setup

Yarn is the our package manager of choice here. Check out setup
instructions [here](https://yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install) if you don't have it installed already.
After that you can run `yarn run bootstrap` to install all the needed dependencies.

From there you can:

- Run the tests once with `yarn test` (Or run them in watch mode with `yarn run tdd`).
- Start a local copy of the docs site with `yarn start`
- Or build a local copy of the library with `yarn run build`
